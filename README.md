# VERTEX X1 — 3D Concept Device (Three.js + Vite)

This project is a **single-page experimental product concept** built to explore how modern frontend tooling can be combined with **Three.js** to render and control a 3D object inside a web interface.

The primary goal was **engineering clarity**, not visual flash.

---

## Why this project exists

The objective of this project was to:

- Understand how **Three.js** integrates with a modern build tool (Vite)
- Work with **3D geometry, lighting, camera, and controls**
- Structure a clean project where **logic, rendering, and UI concerns are separated**
- Practice writing code that is **readable and explainable**, not just functional

This is intentionally kept as a **single-page application**.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** — project setup, dev server, and production build
- **Three.js** — 3D rendering
- **GSAP** — animation support (planned / minimal usage)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — no framework abstraction
- **HTML + CSS** — UI layout and structure

No frontend frameworks were used to keep the focus on core concepts.
